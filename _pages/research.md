# Research

#### Introduction
Our research group is at the forefront of nuclear physics, a field that is essential for unraveling the mysteries of matter at its most intricate level. We focus on the structure and behavior of atomic nuclei, with a particular emphasis on weakly bound nuclei. These nuclei play a crucial role in understanding the fundamental nuclear forces and the stability of atomic structures. Within this sphere, we are captivated by inclusive breakup reactions, which are not only complex but also provide profound insights into the nature of nuclear interactions.

#### Objective of the Research
Our primary objective is to dissect the complexity of nonelastic breakup (NEB) and elastic breakup (EBU) reactions that are induced by weakly bound nuclei. NEB reactions are characterized by the ejection of the nucleus's core and the interaction of the valence particle with the target. EBU reactions, on the other hand, involve the projectile and target fragments remaining in their ground states after the collision. Deciphering these reactions is essential for a comprehensive understanding of nuclear reactions and the stability of exotic nuclei.

#### Literature Review
Building upon the foundation set by previous research in nuclear breakup reactions, we recognize a significant knowledge gap in the full comprehension of NEB and EBU dynamics, particularly in relation to weakly bound nuclei. Our research endeavors to fill this void by conducting a meticulous analysis of these reactions through the synthesis of theoretical models and empirical data.

#### Theoretical Framework
To navigate the complexities of NEB and EBU processes, we have adopted and refined established models grounded in quantum mechanics and nuclear interaction theories. This robust theoretical framework is crucial for an all-encompassing interpretation of the breakup phenomena.

#### Methodology
Our approach combines cutting-edge experimental techniques with sophisticated theoretical modeling. We utilize state-of-the-art particle detection methods and data analysis to investigate breakup reactions. This empirical research is augmented by computational models that simulate a variety of scenarios, enabling us to decode the experimental findings.

#### Significance of the Research
The implications of our work extend beyond the confines of nuclear physics, with significant contributions to our comprehension of nuclear forces and atomic structure stability. The insights from our research have the potential to impact nuclear energy production, medical imaging technologies, and astrophysical studies.

#### Results and Discussion
Our research has unearthed novel insights into the NEB and EBU processes in weakly bound nuclei, enhancing our understanding of nuclear interaction dynamics and the influence of different nuclear forces. We juxtapose our findings with existing studies, delineating the progress our research has achieved.

#### Conclusion and Future Directions
Our research marks a significant milestone in the understanding of inclusive breakup reactions in weakly bound nuclei. It paves the way for future investigations that could explore the broader implications of our findings in various nuclear phenomena and practical applications, thereby driving the field of nuclear physics into new, uncharted territories.

<!-- Our overarching goal is to explore and understand new quantum states of electronic matter on the atomic scale. To do so, we use and develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom.

Our goal is to build instruments and develop techniques that enable us to address the questions we find most interesting. This is possible thanks also to Milan's broad background with different research themes and technologies: he learned his trade in [Seamus Davis’ SI-STM lab](http://davisgroup.lassp.cornell.edu/) and with [Felix Baumberger](http://dpmc.unige.ch/gr_baumberger/index.html), and later moved as an [ETH fellow](http://www.ethfellows.ethz.ch/) to [Andreas Wallraff’s qudev lab](http://www.qudev.ethz.ch/) where he investigated coupled cavity arrays in circuit QED. We further have group members with different background and interests, working together on physics and instrumentation.

Here are some themes and techniques that we currently work on:

**Scanning tunneling noise spectroscopy (STNS).** We have developed a novel cryogenic MHz amplifier that allows us to measure not only the average tunneling current, but also its fluctuation! This has many applications: one can detect the fluctuations of the electronic states, peculiar tunneling processes, and shot noise. We have used this instrument to discover charge trapping in the insulating layer of the cuprates, connected to the c-axis mystery, and to measure the doubling of the charge due to Andreev processes to the superfluid in a lead sample.


**Mott physics and high-temperature superconductivity.** Questions of interest include: (i), How does the Mott state collapse upon doping and how is this related to the complex phase diagram of high-temperature superconductors? (ii), What is the strange metal phase seen in correlated electron systems? Is this an exotic long-range entangled state? What is the mechanism of dissipation in that state? (iii), Why is the transition temperature in high-temperature superconductors so high? We have worked on iridates, rhodates, and cuprates.

**Nanofabricated "Smart Tips"**.

One of the  projects back from my job-proposal is to develop nanofabricated STM tips. The idea behind these “smart tips” is to use the technologies that were developed over decades in nanofabrication and make them available for scanning probe by using a nano-device instead of the traditional STM tungsten tip. One gains the flexibility of using different functionalities that are known from the fields of nanofabrication and mesoscopic physics. We are collaborating with the group Simon Groeblacher at TU Delft to realize this concept, benefitting from their unparalleled micro/nano fabrication know how.  A prototype of a smart tip is shown to the left. See publications in Microsyst Nanoeng, Nanotechnology, and PRB.

**Josephson STM.** Josephson STM has the ability to gain insight into spatial variations of the order parameter, or superfluid density. We have managed to, for the first time, use JSTM with atomic resolution on a quantum material.
We have used atomic-resolution Josephson scanning tunneling microscopy to reveal a strongly inhomogeneous superfluid in the iron-based superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45. The results and their implications are published in Nature.

We also detected and investigated a quite particular YSR state in the same material.

**Ultra-stable SI-STM instrument.**  ![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/respic/STMHead.png){: style="width: 250px; float: right; margin: 0px 10px"}
For SI-STM, having the most stable STM head is key. We have used finite element simulations, good choices in material science, and craftsmanship to build the most stable STM head in the world, to our knowledge. See publication in RSI.


**Strange Metals.** The strange metal phase might be the most mysterious phase of high-temperature superconductors. Here, the electrical resistivity grows linearly with temperature T in large areas of the phase diagram, with a mean free path that diminishes to a fraction of the interatomic distance. T-linear resistivity is often associated with quantum critical points and marginal-Fermi-liquid physics. In strange metals, the mystery seems to go even further: we deal with something that looks like a quantum critical phase over an extended range of the phase diagram instead of cumulating in a point. There exists no consistent theory for strange metals, leading to more adventurous new approaches including the holographic theories that use insights from gravity to explain strange metals (a recent textbook on this was written by our colleagues at Leiden University, Schalm and Zaanen).
We are part of the 'Strange Metal consortium NL' that includes the groups of Hussey, Golden, van Heumen, Zaanen, Schalm, Stoof and Vandoren. 

**Magnetic fluctuations and electron spin resonance.**

**Twisted bilayer graphene and other material with super-periodicities.**
We have proposed that artificial super-periodicities can lead to improved superconductivity, both because of increased density of states and because of phase space arguments (see image from our SciPost publication below). Perhaps for different reasons, twisted bilayer graphene has been shown to superconduct! We are investigate this material with the groups of Efetov, Baumberger, and van der Molen.
