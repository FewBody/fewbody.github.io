A postdoctoral fellow position is available at the Department of Physics, Tongji University, Shanghai. Tongji is one of the longest-standing, most selective, and most prestigious universities in China under the Project 985. It is a Chinese Ministry of Education Class A Double First Class University. According to the 2022 QS World University Rankings, Tongji University ranked 8th nationally. Applicants must have a Ph.D. in physics (or anticipate having a Ph.D. in hand by the end of 2022). The research interests of the group cover a broad range of topics. These include nuclear reactions near the neutron- and proton-drip lines with particular emphasis on halo nuclei and direct reactions. Research topics in nuclear structure include alpha decay, alpha clustering, halo nuclei, and superheavy nuclei. We attack these problems using a variety of forefront techniques including effective field theory, relativistic mean-field theory, CDCC method and Faddeev techniques. Preference will be given to expertise in nuclear reaction. More informations about the group can be found at https://tanthco.github.io . Thus applicants should have a strong research record and display significant initiative to complement their research skills. The appointment will initially be for one year. Renewal for up to two more years is highly probable, but is contingent on funding and job performance.
