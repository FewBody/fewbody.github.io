**About Tanthco:**

The Tangram Nuclear Theory Collaboration (Tanthco) was initiated by nuclear theory groups at Tongji University (Shanghai), Hehai University (Nanjing) and Central China Normal University (Wuhan) in China to promote collaboration, communication and education under the topics of theoretical development in nuclear structure and reaction physics. The name Tangram is inspired by an old polygon puzzle game to indicate the variety of collaborative possibilities of Tanthco in geographical locations, activities and research subjects. The current form of Tanthco consists of three programs, seminar forum, student meetup, and science workshop, hosting online events to promote multilateral collaboration and discussions among universities and institutes.

**Seminar Forum:**

The seminar forum is to organize online scientific talks focused on (but not limited to) recent theoretical development of nuclear structure and reaction physics. The forum invites experts from all of the world to share their knowledge and insights about their studies, and encourages discussions among speakers and listeners.

**Student Meetup**

 The student meetup organizes regular online group learning sessions to create opportunities for students to learn state-of-the-art nuclear theory related subjects. The programs and learning subjects are organized by senior researchers. Students from different universities can meet online regularly during the self-learning sessions, guided by senior researchers, and are enrolled to participate in a series of  lectures during the program.

**Science Workshop:**

 The science workshop is to promote collaborations among universities under the subject of nuclear theory, and hopes to bring brainstorming new ideas during the discussions and collaborations. Current activities include collaborative studies in few-body nuclear theories focused on its application to nuclear reactions.

**More Voices, More Ears:**

 Tanthco encourages more universities and research groups to join or host scientific activities and is to create a lively communication environment among Chinese nuclear theorists. Tanthco welcomes new members to bring new ideas and activity possibilities to the collaboration.
