# 2021/12/23.
*  Going on playing with plots of probability density functions (pdfs) using the scipy.stats and numpy libraries. <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/Exploring_pdfs.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
*  Discussing the different cases that contains two or more distributions e.g. plot of beta distribution and gauss distribution in the same coordinate, which is enlightening to distinguish the wave functions.

*  Playing with plots of probability density functions (pdfs) using the scipy.stats and numpy libraries. <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/Exploring_pdfs.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
*  Compare the characteristics of different distribution functions e.g. beta distribution and gauss distribution.

# 2021/12/9
* Analysising the examples of the unfair coin and Covid-2019 testing from Bayes theorem. 
* Standard medical example (Covid-2019) by applying Bayesian rules of probability. <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/medical_example_by_Bayes_KEY.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
* Learning to use Jupiter and scipy.stats from the example of unfair coin, and at the same whole, to comprehend how to update that information after observing some data (this is the posterior pdf). <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/Bayesian_updating_coinflip_interactive.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
