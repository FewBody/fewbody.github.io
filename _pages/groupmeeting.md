# Group Meeting

# 2021/12/9
* Analysising the examples of the unfair coin and Covid-2019 testing from Bayes theorem. 
* Standard medical example (Covid-2019) by applying Bayesian rules of probability. <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/medical_example_by_Bayes_KEY.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
* Learning to use Jupiter and scipy.stats from the example of unfair coin, and at the same whole, to comprehend how to update that information after observing some data (this is the posterior pdf). <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/Bayesian_updating_coinflip_interactive.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>

# Next meeting will take place in 13:30 on the 12/15.
*  To play with plots of probability density functions (pdfs) using the scipy.stats and numpy libraries. <a href="https://github.com/NuclearTalent/Bayes2019/blob/master/topics/basics-of-bayesian-statistics/Exploring_pdfs.ipynb">jupiternotes</a>
